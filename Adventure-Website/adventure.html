        <p class="text">
            While the definition of adventure can vary from person to person, in broader context “risk taken when its outcome is unknown” can be termed as adventure. It is something that challenges you, it is something that lets you escape from your ordinary lives & thus it is something that changes you. It can make you feel more live & refreshed. Adventures can be sought in numerous ways such as mountaineering, river rafting, trekking, skydiving, scuba diving, etc. Even exploring new people & cities can be considered as an adventure.
<br><br>
            Adventure in many ways has been proven beneficial for us. Surmounting a challenge during an adventure is a brilliant way to leave us feeling positive about ourselves & thus has a positive impact on our mental health. Adventure & exploration can also really help us expand our horizons about nature, culture & more. Sometimes, it can also help us have a deeper insight about ourselves. This happens when we let ourselves loose in an unfamiliar situation. It can let our hidden strengths unveil and make us push our limits.

          <h2 class="description">BIKING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
            Bicycles have become even more important in recent times. While they have been offering us many advantages for a long time, they are very vital now. It is because of the rate at which pollution is growing in the world, they offer a greener way to commute.
<br><br>
            In other words, bicycles do not require any petrol or diesel which harms our atmosphere. Further, it does not leave a carbon footprint as well. Thus, it is a great choice for everyone especially those who are environment-friendly.
            <br><br>
            After that, we see that bicycles do not possess the potential to harm anyone, unlike bikes, cars and buses. If you ride a bicycle, you are less likely to hurt someone or get in an accident as compared to ones who ride bikes or drive cars.
            <br><br>
            Most importantly, bicycles are great for our health. There are numerous benefits which cycling offers to ensure a healthy life. It is not only a great alternative to gym workouts but also helps prevent cardiovascular diseases.
            <br><br>
            Therefore, bicycles help to preserve our health. Similarly, they do not harm the environment. Moreover, they are also very beneficial as we can go through narrow roads with a bicycle which we cannot do with bikes or cars.

        </div>
        <p class="text">
            Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders: lightweight,
            free-flying, foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure.[1] The pilot sits in a
            harness or lies supine in a cocoon-like 'speed bag' suspended below a fabric wing. Wing shape
            is maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure of air entering vents in the front of the wing,
            and the aerodynamic forces of the air flowing over the outside

          <h2 class="description">SURFING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
            Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores, but can also be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave pools.

            The term surfing refers to a person riding a wave using a board, regardless of the stance. There are several types of boards. The Moche of Peru would often surf on reed craft, while the native peoples of the Pacific surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such water craft. Ancient cultures often surfed on their belly and knees, while the modern-day definition of surfing most often refers to a surfer riding a wave standing on a surfboard; this is also referred to as stand-up surfing.
            
            Another prominent form of surfing is body boarding, where a surfer rides the wave on a bodyboard, either lying on their belly, drop knee (one foot and one knee on the board), or sometimes even standing up on a body board. Other types of surfing include knee boarding, surf matting (riding inflatable mats) and using foils. Body surfing, in which the wave is caught and ridden using the surfer's own body rather than a board, is very common and is considered by some surfers to be the purest form of surfing. The closest form of body surfing using a board is a handboard which normally has one strap over it to fit on one hand. Surfers who body board, body surf, or handboard feel more drag as they move through the water than stand up surfers do. This holds body surfers into a more turbulent part of the wave (often completely submerged by whitewater). In contrast, surfers who instead ride a hydrofoil feel substantially less drag and may ride unbroken waves in the open ocean.
